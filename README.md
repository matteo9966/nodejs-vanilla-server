**This project is still in progress!**


# This is a Simple node JS Server that performs the crud operations
---
The project doesn't use the Express package.
It uses only the NodeJS built in modules!

---

##### In this project I used these node modules: 
* fs module
* path module
* http module


##### Other dependencies:
* uuid module

---
There isnt any real database, the crud operations are performed on a JSON file!
